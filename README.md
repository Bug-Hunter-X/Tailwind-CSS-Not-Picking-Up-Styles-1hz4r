# Tailwind CSS Not Picking Up Styles

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: the styles not being picked up by the compiler due to incorrect configuration.

The problem arises when the `content` array in the `tailwind.config.js` file doesn't correctly point to the files containing your Tailwind classes.  This prevents the compiler from identifying and generating the necessary CSS for those classes.

## Setup:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the development server (if applicable). 

## Solution

The `tailwind-solution.config.js` file presents the corrected configuration, where the `content` array accurately specifies the file paths for both the HTML and component files. This ensures that Tailwind CSS correctly identifies and generates the CSS rules for your classes.
